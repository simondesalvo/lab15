<h3>Why hire Simon?</h3>
<p>Simon is a pretty brilliant librarian with a master's degree in digital content management.
    <br>
    Now that he's learning OOP he'll be unstoppable.
    <br>
    He's also extraordinarily humble.
    <br><br>
    But no, for real, please hire him.
</p>
<h3>What else does Simon bring to the table?</h3>
<p>Even before covid, Simon had experience working and learning remotely- he already has a home office setup!
    <br>
    Simon also has previous teaching experience, and as a former public librarian, oodles of experience working with all kinds of people.
    <br>
    He also has a ton of experience with professional collaborative projects!
    <br>
    Most recently, at the Detroit Public Library, he worked remotely with other librarians at different branches to create an LGBTQ Pride Booklist.
    <br>
    Their work was selected for a number of library conferences, but alas, covid.
