      <h3>Who the heck is Simon anyway?</h3>
      <p>
          A pretty cool dude!
          <br><br>
          But no really, he plays a bunch of string instruments, was one of the top Pac-Man players in the world,
          and he has a habit of bouncing back from adversity with new skills (great recession: grad school! Covid? Coding bootcamp!).
          <br><br>
          He also has a wide variety of professional experiences, each one focused on customer service, so he's pretty good with people.
          <br><br>
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/simon-desalvo-61041b2a/">Find him on LinkedIn!</a>
          <br><br>
          Or shoot him an email at simondesalvo @ gmail (not a link to avoid spambots)
          <br><br>
          He's originally from Muskegon, MI, but that's not super important. he's called Metro Detroit home since he turned 18.
